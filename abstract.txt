This project introduces an innovative AI-powered Resume Analyzer designed to address critical challenges in modern recruitment. Facing an overwhelming influx of applications, recruiters struggle with time-consuming manual screening processes and the potential for unconscious biases to influence candidate selection. This system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs), orchestrated through Genkit flows, to intelligently analyze resumes against job descriptions. Key features include: (1) precise extraction and categorization of skills; (2) calculation of a comprehensive match score reflecting candidate suitability; (3) identification of candidate strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement; (4) automated generation of personalized interview questions; and (5) intelligent estimation of appropriate salary ranges. The system also automates the generation of rejection emails for candidates who do not meet the minimum qualifications, providing them with specific feedback for improvement. By automating and enhancing key steps in the candidate selection process, this AI Resume Analyzer delivers significant benefits, including: reduced recruiter workload, more objective and equitable candidate assessment, faster time-to-hire, and improved candidate engagement. Ultimately, this project demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in streamlining and optimizing recruitment workflows, benefiting both organizations and job seekers.
